Why Design and analysis of Algorithm? 

=> One computer problem might have several versions of a solution. In this case, every appraoch taken to solve the computer problem is correct. However, choosing the best-suited solution will improve the efficency of the program.

    There might be a msiconception that smaller algorithms are best-suited solutions in most cases. But, a feasible solution is not based on the length of algorithm, but the one with efficient complexity(time and space complexity).
    
        We study Design and Analysis of Algorithm to analyse the complexity of all the version of a solution to a computer problem.
